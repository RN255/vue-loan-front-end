## Project Name: Loan application Front End Test (Vue)
This is the same website I have previously created but this time it was made using Vue.

*This is a front end for a loan application. Users can type in a desired loan amount and select the repayment period.*

## Motivation
I wanted to learn Vue.

## Tech used
- Vue

## Project features
- same as previous version
  - *fully responsive web design*
  - *HTML forms*
  - *user side form validation - The page will display an error message if the user doesn't enter the correct information.*

## Lessons learnt
- fundamentals of Vue

## future development
- As with the previous version of this website there are many features that could be added  
  - *It could be expanded to have other sections and pages, maybe a screen telling the user what they have asked for.*
  - *The logo is just a picture I have, it could be changed to another logo, some text or a png file.*
- I could expand this to be more complex and increase my understanding of Vue

## How to use
Website is not currently live.
